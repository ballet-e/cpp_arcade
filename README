Epitech 2nd year project in C++

The goal of this project is to discover the goals of modular programming.

We can create multiples library (.so) and use them at runtime.

There is two type of library, the first one is "Graphic" used for display the game. Graphic library implement too a menu for let the user choose his graphic library (if he want to change) and the game which he want to play.

The second type is "Game". He used the Graphic library in order to display information / text about the game and the game.

With this project, if a class respect our interfaces, you can create your library and run our game. That's the same if you want to create a game and run with our library.

Games loader respecting specific class abstraction. Lib loader respecting specific class abstraction.

Made by Erwan Ballet, Victorien Fischer and Arnaud Wurmel.
